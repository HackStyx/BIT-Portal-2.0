## Introduction
The current student portal at BIT faces several usability challenges, with limited functionality and outdated design. This project proposes a complete overhaul of the portal to address these issues, aiming to create a user-friendly, responsive, and accessible platform that streamlines essential academic interactions. 

## Objectives
1. **Modernize the UI/UX**: Enhance usability with an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing interface.
2. **Improve Responsiveness**: Ensure optimal experience across all device types (mobile, tablet, desktop).
3. **Strengthen Security**: Implement encrypted logins and role-based access control.
4. **Enhance Core Features**: Simplify navigation and improve accessibility for attendance, fee status, and academic records.
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Utilize a modular backend for future feature expansion.
6. **Real-time Feedback System**: Allow students to submit feedback instantly.
7. **Dynamic Data Storage**: Integrate MongoDB for scalable data handling.

## Features
- **Secure Login and Authentication**: Role-based login for students and faculty, with CAPTCHA and password recovery.
- **Student Dashboard**: Personalized dashboard displaying profile, attendance, IA marks, fee status, and announcements.
- **Feedback System**: Interactive feedback tool with real-time submission and review.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly layout optimized for various screen sizes.

## Architecture
BIT Portal 2.0 follows a standard MERN stack architecture:
1. **Frontend** (React): Handles UI/UX and client-side interactivity.
2. **Backend** (Node.js + Express): Manages HTTP requests, API routes, and business logic.
3. **Database** (MongoDB): Stores student data, attendance, marks, and feedback.
4. **Authentication**: Utilizes JWT for secure login and session management.

## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB**: For NoSQL, dynamic data storage.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling API requests and server management.
- **React.js**: For frontend, responsive UI and state management.
- **Node.js**: Server environment for executing JavaScript backend.

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion, BIT Portal 2.0 will provide a highly functional, responsive, and secure digital portal that enhances the student experience at BIT. The portal will streamline interactions, facilitate secure access to academic data, and offer a user-friendly platform for students and faculty.
